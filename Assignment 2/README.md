# üóÑÔ∏è Database Queries with SQLAlchemy & Pandas

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates running **SQL queries** from Python using **SQLAlchemy** and **Pandas**.  
The database contains four related tables:

- `product` ‚Äì makers and models  
- `pc` ‚Äì PC models and their details  
- `laptop` ‚Äì Laptop models and their details  
- `printer` ‚Äì Printer models and their details  

The queries explore different aspects of the dataset such as most expensive PCs, number of laptops per maker, and unified product catalogs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **SQLAlchemy** ‚Äì database connection
- **SQLite / Any RDBMS** ‚Äì database backend
- **Pandas** ‚Äì data analysis & display

## üìä Implemented Queries

### üîπ Query 1 ‚Äì Most Expensive PC per Maker
Finds the most expensive **PC model** for each maker.

```sql
SELECT p.maker, pc.model, pc.price
FROM product p
JOIN pc ON p.model = pc.model
WHERE pc.price = (
    SELECT MAX(pc2.price)
    FROM product p2
    JOIN pc pc2 ON p2.model = pc2.model
    WHERE p2.maker = p.maker
)
ORDER BY pc.price DESC;
```

---

### üîπ Query 2 ‚Äì Laptop Models per Maker
Counts how many **laptop models** each maker produces.

```sql
SELECT p.maker, COUNT(*) AS laptop_count
FROM product p
JOIN laptop l ON p.model = l.model
GROUP BY p.maker
ORDER BY laptop_count DESC, p.maker;
```

---

### üîπ Query 3 ‚Äì Unified Catalog with Price Ranges
Creates a combined catalog of all products (PCs, Laptops, Printers)  
and summarizes **minimum, maximum, and average price** per maker and type.

```sql
WITH all_products AS (
    SELECT p.maker, p.model, 'PC' AS type, pc.price
    FROM product p JOIN pc ON p.model = pc.model
    UNION ALL
    SELECT p.maker, p.model, 'Laptop', l.price
    FROM product p JOIN laptop l ON p.model = l.model
    UNION ALL
    SELECT p.maker, p.model, 'Printer', pr.price
    FROM product p JOIN printer pr ON p.model = pr.model
)
SELECT maker, type, 
       MIN(price) AS min_price, 
       MAX(price) AS max_price, 
       ROUND(AVG(price),2) AS avg_price
FROM all_products
GROUP BY maker, type
ORDER BY maker, type;
```

## üöÄ How to Run

Each query is executed in Python and results are displayed in Pandas DataFrames.  

Example:
```python
with engine.connect() as conn:
    q1 = """
    SELECT p.maker, pc.model, pc.price
    FROM product p
    JOIN pc ON p.model = pc.model
    WHERE pc.price = (
        SELECT MAX(pc2.price)
        FROM product p2
        JOIN pc pc2 ON p2.model = pc2.model
        WHERE p2.maker = p.maker
    )
    ORDER BY pc.price DESC;
    """
    q1_df = pd.read_sql_query(text(q1), conn)
q1_df
```

## üìå Notes
- The schema used here is the classic **Product-PC-Laptop-Printer** schema used in database courses.  
- Queries are kept **modular** and can be extended easily.  
- Works with any SQLAlchemy-compatible database (`SQLite`, `Postgres`, `MySQL`, etc.).
